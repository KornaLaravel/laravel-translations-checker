# Supported versions
While we try to support as many laravel / php versions as possible that is not always possible. 
Below you can find a table with the supported versions per laravel-translation-checker version.

## Versions table 
| **Laravel-translation-checker version** | **Laravel version** | **php version** |
|:---------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|
|                   v1                    |     9.* & 10.*      |    8.1 & 8.2    |                                                                                     |
|                  v0.*                   |  8.* & 9.* & 10.*   | 8.0 & 8.1 & 8.2 |                                                                                 |

## Notes
Below are some caveats with certain versions. Please note them if you are using these versions together.

#### Laravel 10 & php 8.0
Laravel 10 does not support php 8.0, so we have not tested these versions together.
